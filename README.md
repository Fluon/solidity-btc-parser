## Bitcoin transaction parsing library for Solidity

This is a library of useful functions for dealing with raw Bitcoin
transaction bytes inside of Ethereum contracts written in Solidity.

It has been created with the intention of on-chain processing of
output from [BTC-relay][btcrelay].

[btcrelay]: https://github.com/ethereum/btcrelay

This library is still in development and should **not be relied
upon**. There are probably bugs and the API may change.
